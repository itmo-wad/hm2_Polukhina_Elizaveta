## Description
The project implements user authentication in the form via the POST method. Upon successful authorization, the username is recorded in the session and the user profile is displayed. 

When you log out of your account, the session is cleared.

If the input is unsuccessful, the user is prompted to re-enter the authorization data.

If the user is not logged in, they cannot get into the profile, as they are redirected to the authentication page.

Usernames and passwords are stored in MongoDB.
